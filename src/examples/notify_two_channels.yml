  Send a Glue notification to two targets simultaneously.
  By default, if no target parameter is set, the $GLUE_DEFAULT_TARGET value will be used (must be set).
  A custom target, or comma-separated list of targets can be supplied via the "target" parameter.

  It is recommended to use the "target ID" for the value(s).
